Evaluate whether all major factual claims in the answer are supported by a bracketed citation.
Citation completeness measures whether claims without citations exist in the answer.

Answer:
{answer}

Rate the citation completeness on a scale of 0 to 1, where 1 means every factual claim has a citation.
If the answer makes no factual claims, score 1.0.
Respond with just a number between 0 and 1, followed by a brief reason.
